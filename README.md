# CC0-models
I hope to create a collection of models available and free to anyone to use, whether academic, commercial or just for fun.

# Why?
While working on my master thesis I needed some visualizations which I needed to draw myself because existing material was either copyrighted or there was no clarity about the applicable license.

# Contribute
Feel free to contribute or fork. Anything you might think is useful for others.
There are no strict rules (for now)...

Just use pull requests to get your content in this repository and try to avoid closed standards.
Also make sure that if you use (derived) content it can be (re)published under the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.

# Resources
It can be hard to find icons and other resources which can be used in CC0 work, so here is a list of usable sets:

- https://useiconic.com/open/ (MIT)
- http://ionicons.com/ (MIT)
- https://thenounproject.com/ (CC and Public Domain)
